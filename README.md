# Covid-Data-Analysis-using-SQL

COVID-19 took a toll on everyone's lives. The thought behind choosing this dataset was to explore the data and take note of the countries which experience most number of deaths of the infected people and the perecentage of population who are affected and vaccinated to fight the virus. I analysed the data and came up with certain questions that I will address.

-- What are the percentage of deaths for the total number of the cases(who are infected) found?

-- Which is the country with the highest infection rate in comparison to population?

-- Which continent is with the highest death count?

-- What is the total number of cases across various continents and locations on a daily basis?

-- What population is vaccinated with atleast one vaccine in a particular location?
